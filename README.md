# Jesse
Jesse is an AMP theme for Orchard CMS sites. It requires the AMP module to function. 

It is based loosely off of the Wordpress AMP Theme by Jesse Hanley, which can be seen here: https://github.com/jessehanley/wordpress-amp-theme

It is targetted at blogs but should support any AMP enabled content. The theme supports the blog page as well as individual post pages, providing an all AMP experience for your users, should you so wish.
